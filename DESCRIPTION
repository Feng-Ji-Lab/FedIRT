Description: Integrate Item Response Theory (IRT) and Federated Learning to estimate traditional IRT models, including the 2-Parameter Logistic (2PL) and the Graded Response Models, with enhanced privacy. It allows for the estimation in a distributed manner without compromising accuracy. A user-friendly 'shiny' application is included.
